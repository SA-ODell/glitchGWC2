    <h2>It's time to make some muffins!</h2>

    <p>
        We're doing the Girls Who Code #codingathome Week2 project, building a
        tutorial website, and it's made with
        <a href="https://glitch.com">Glitch</a>!
    </p>

    <p>
        So let's make some muffins! And not just some, but a whole monthful. This
        is a great project for at-home schooling for kids of all ages, because you
        get to practive with math (measurements and proportions), you build
        reading skills (by following directions), and you make something healthy
        and tasty to share with the whole family.

    <h3>
        Here's what you need:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups of Raisin Bran cereal (about one 14 oz box)</li>
        <li>3 cups sugar</li>
        <li>5 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>4 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup oil</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1.5 cups dried cranberries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Here are the steps:
    </p>

    <p>
        1) In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients: the cereal, flour, sugar,
        baking soda, and salt.
    </p>
    <p>
        2) In a separate bowl, combine the wet ingredient (buttermilk, oil, and
        eggs) and whisk until smooth and completely blended.
    </p>
    <p>
        3) Pour the buttermilk/eggs/oil mixture into the cereal/flour/sugar/baking
        soda/salt bowl and gently stir until just blended, and then fold in the
        cranberries.
    </p>
    <p>
        4) Place in a tightly sealed container and refrigerate overnight.
        Important: do not stir the mixture again. When you need some batter, spoon
        from the top — do not remix the batter.
    </p>
    <p>
        5) When you're ready for muffins, set the oven to 400º. Grease muffin pan
        and spoon in the batter. Bake 18 minutes (check the first time with a
        toothpick). Cool in the pan for a couple of minutes, then serve warm or
        throw ‘em in your lunch box.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can make just two muffins, a small tray of half a dozen, or whatever
        quantity you want. The batter lasts about a month, so take your time, or
        go full muffin-monster on them.
